# Whiz-Bang
This app is very basic.  What it does is makes it much easier to send customers their monthly bill. It stores their name and email address or phone number in a database using a content provider. Then you select the person you want to send a bill to and enter the amount and press send. Then based on what contact information is stored in the database it will either email or text the amount owed.
